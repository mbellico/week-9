# "Become a QA Automation weeks 9 and 10 - Creating Login and Register Forms"

## What is the Project about?
During this Project, I will be creating a Login and a Register Form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Once done, I'll introduce validations to the forms, that will be executed when some events occur. Every field on the form will have a series of conditions that will be validated when events are triggered. Once the fields on the form are validated, the data will be sent to a fictional webpage through an HTTP request.
